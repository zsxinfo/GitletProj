Gitlet is project2 of CS61B Spring 2021. Here's my implementation of it. It's a version-control system that mimics some of the basic features of the popular system Git. But it's smaller and simpler, so it's called Gitlet. You can find more infomation here.

It's a course project for learning purpose, which is about managing complexity of large code base  project. (Not really big in real world, but relatively big in school labs.) The most valuable thing I learn from this project is about writing readable clean code. I think it's important when working with team members or other people, and for your own future reviews as well.
